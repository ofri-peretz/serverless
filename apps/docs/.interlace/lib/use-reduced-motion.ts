 * Reads `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` and reacts to user changes.
 *
 * The CSS reset in `brand.css` already neutralizes most animations for users
 * who request reduced motion (sets `animation-duration: 0.01ms`). This hook
 * is for components that need to **structurally** behave differently — e.g.
 * skip an opacity fade-in entirely, render a static frame instead of an
 * animation loop, or stop a `requestAnimationFrame` loop to save battery.
 *
 * Returns `false` during SSR so the first paint matches the no-motion-pref
 * default; flips to the actual preference on hydration. Components that
 * use this should make sure their no-motion path is the more conservative
 * (less expensive) render so SSR HTML is small.
