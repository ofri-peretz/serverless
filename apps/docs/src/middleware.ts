 * Counts fetches of the AI-facing docs surfaces.

 * Ported from the eslint docs app, where the reasoning is the same and the
 * numbers are measured: 86% of traffic across the Interlace properties is
 * direct and organic search is 4.4%, so "an assistant recommended it" is a
 * real acquisition path — and the one we have no measurement for. PostHog
 * classified 33 pageviews from Claude Desktop and 3 from NotebookLM in 60
 * days, but posthog-js only sees clients that execute JavaScript, and the
 * agents that read llms.txt mostly do not.
 *
 * Why middleware rather than the route handlers: both `llms.txt` and
 * `llms-full.txt` are `revalidate = false`, so their GET runs once at build
 * time and never per request — instrumenting them there would have counted
 * exactly one fetch, at build. Forcing them dynamic is worse, since
 * `llms-full.txt` is assembled from every docs page and per-request generation
 * turns a crawler into a load generator. Middleware observes the request
 * without changing how either file is served.
