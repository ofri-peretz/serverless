## The five breakpoints (Tailwind v4 defaults — do not override)

| Token  | min-width      | Use                                                                         |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sm:`  | 40rem / 640px  | Phablet → small tablet portrait. Default for "stop being one-column."       |
| `md:`  | 48rem / 768px  | Tablet portrait. Default for two-column layouts and showing horizontal nav. |
| `lg:`  | 64rem / 1024px | Tablet landscape / small laptop. Default for three-column grids.            |
| `xl:`  | 80rem / 1280px | Desktop. Reserved for content that genuinely benefits from a wider canvas.  |
| `2xl:` | 96rem / 1536px | Large desktop. Rare. Hero / marquee / decorative scaling only.              |

These are Tailwind v4's built-in defaults. We use them as-is — no
`@theme` overrides, no `--breakpoint-*` custom variables, no
`min-[Xpx]:` or `max-[Xpx]:` arbitrary variants. **A breakpoint that
doesn't appear in the table above does not exist** in our apps.

## Why no custom breakpoints

Every custom breakpoint is a contract the next person (or the next
agent) doesn't know about. A site of four apps with synchronised
breakpoints stays predictable; one app with a custom `2.5xl:` at 1440px
breaks the muscle memory of everyone editing the others, and the screen
size where the bug appears stops mapping to the design tokens used at
review time. The cost of "I'll just add one more" compounds — six
months in, no one remembers which app uses which set, and the marketing
landing, the docs site, and the blog start rendering differently at the
laptop sizes our users actually have.

If a layout looks wrong at exactly 920px, the answer is **not** to
introduce a custom breakpoint between `sm` (640) and `md` (768) and
`lg` (1024). The answer is to redesign the layout so it works through
that range with one of the three.

## Forbidden patterns (lint-locked where the app has vitest)

- `@theme inline { --breakpoint-* : ... }` in any `*.css` file under `src/`.
- `screens: { … }` in any legacy `tailwind.config.*` file.
- `className="… min-[920px]:flex …"` — any `min-[…px]:` / `max-[…px]:`
  arbitrary breakpoint variant in source. (Container queries `@…` are
  fine; this rule is only about viewport breakpoints.)
- `"tailwindcss": "^4"` (unpinned) in any app `package.json` — pin to
  `^4.1.18` or higher so a future minor that bumps the default scale
  can't drift a single app silently.

## Where the lock lives

| Surface                         | Lock                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eslint/apps/docs`              | `src/__tests__/breakpoints-lock.test.ts`                  |
| `agents/apps/interlace-landing` | `src/__tests__/breakpoints-lock.test.ts`                  |
| `agents/apps/blog`              | No vitest in this app yet — doc-only. PR review enforces. |
| `serverless/apps/docs`          | `src/__tests__/breakpoints-lock.test.ts`                  |

Each lock asserts:

1. No `--breakpoint-` overrides in any `.css` under `src/`.
2. No `min-[Xpx]:` / `max-[Xpx]:` viewport arbitraries in source
   (`.ts` / `.tsx` / `.css`).
3. The app's own `package.json` pins `tailwindcss` to `^4.1.18` or higher.

A failure means either the violation is a real bug (revert) or the
contract has changed (edit this doc in **all three repos** and update
every lock test, then come back).

## When to widen or narrow the table

Never per-app. The table is a synchronised contract. If a real product
need surfaces — e.g. a 1920px design-system breakpoint for an enterprise
dashboard — propose it in a PR that touches all three repos in the same
diff. Any single-repo bump is a leak; review will block it.

## Mobile-first reminder

We write mobile-first. Default styles target ≤ 640px. `sm:` / `md:` /
`lg:` only _add_ behaviour at larger viewports. Never use a desktop
default and then override with `max-[…]` to "fix" mobile — flip the
authoring direction. The CLAUDE.md instructions for the `eslint` repo
already require reproducing layout regressions at ~390px before claiming
a fix; that practice applies in all three.
